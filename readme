This program is intended for use with an Arduino (atmega328) platform for
controlling fermentation temperature of beer in my low tech refrigeration
system.

The hardware required for this include a 2x16 LCD with the serial LCD interface
PIC from phanderson.com, LM34 temp sensors, 2n2222 transistors, and resistors as
needed.
